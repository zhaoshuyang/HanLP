## Development

### Set-up

Get the source code of this project using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hankcs/HanLP
cd HanLP
pip install -e plugins/hanlp_trie
pip install -e plugins/hanlp_common
pip install -e plugins/hanlp_restful
pip install -e .
```

To work on this project, you need Python 3.6 or newer.

### Running Tests

This project has a test suite to ensure certain important APIs work properly. The tests can be run using:

```console
$ python plugins/hanlp_trie/tests/test_trie.py
```

:::{tip}
It's hard to cover every API especially those of deep learning models, due to the limited computation resource of CI. However, we suggest all inference APIs to be tested at least.

## Repository structure

This repository is a split into a few critical folders:

hanlp/
: The HanLP core package, containing the Python code.

plugins/
: Contains codes shared across several individual packages or non core APIs.

docs/
: The documentation for HanLP, which is in markdown format mostly.
: The build configuration is contained in `conf.py`.

tests/
: Testing infrastructure that uses `unittest` to ensure the output of API is what we expect it to be.

.github/workflows/
: Contains Continuous-integration (CI) workflows, run on commits/PRs to the GitHub repository.
